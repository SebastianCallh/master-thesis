* Meetings
** Startup meeting with Heintz
   <2019-01-07 mån>   
*** Initial project- Arrival time prediction with a motion pattern model using GPs
     - A working implementation exists from this years TDDE19 
     - Compare with vector field (position -> velocity), LSTM (from TDDE19)

*** Areas of improvement from TDDE19
    - Sparse GPs
    - Synchronisation. Interpolate posterior mean functions, cluster.
    - Data augmentation
    - Start and stop boundaries
    - Multiple stop prediction
    - Time table feature

*** Notes
    Heintz had some ideas on interesting problems.

**** Superimposing effects 
     The idea is in isolation train a nominal trajectory, one for rush
     hour, on for normal traffics, etc. And in some way superimpose
     the effects, letting us ask questions like "what if we drive
     this way instead?" or  "what if it was winter?".

**** Knowledge extraction
     Predicting arrival time is fine, but not novel
     enough. Fortunately, the GP model offers plenty of insight in the
     data generating process. 

***** Worst/best scenarios     
      If the model was extended to work for
      multiple future stops it could give an estimate of the earliest
      known arrival time, and the latest known. 

***** Pattern extraction
      It would be interesting to extract patterns from the
      data, both spatially and temporally. For instance: stop lights, 
      traffic jams, average speed (?), speed change. During what circumstances
      does the predictions have highest variance?

*** Post meeting talk
    Some ideas that felt reasonable after talking to Tiger after the
    meeting with Heintz.
    - Extract events using kernels/convolution over motion patterns
    - Extending the application to multiple future stops
    - Comparing predictive distribution to the actual arrival times,
      and the predictions of LSTM/vector field model 

** Feedback meeting with Tiger
*** Research questions
**** Is this the most interesting problem?
**** Is the scope of questions reasonable?
      
*** How much to flesh out deterministic methods?
*** Will there be a later subsection where the syncronization ("inverse GP") approach is discussed and referenced?
     - Some synchronisation need to be done, could be with DTW/LCSS
       or inverse GP
     - Find inverse GP synchronisation, and compare it to DTW/LCSSö

*** Write down a case for the final model

*** Related work for event identification
    Automatic statistician, search kernel space, and the kernels
    chosen correspond to events

*** Write down model step by step
    Motivate the models advantages, talk about subproblems. 
    Motivate that the are hard, and what solving them entails.
    Comparing trajectories
    Distance metrics
    Synchronisation 
    Prediction
    Clustering (motion pattern learning)

**** Is the inverse GP model the way to go?
     Sure why not. Make a running example for the application in introduction.

** Thesis plan meeting with Heintz

     See individual [[sub-problems]]

   - [X] On the chosen solution, motivate why this is valid

***** Arrival time prediction
***** Trajectory model
      GPR successfully used for trajectories cite:Kim2011Nov

***** Synchronisation
***** Similarity metric
***** Clustering algorithm
***** Regression model
      cite:Rasmussen-Williams-2006 claim GPs "a serious competitor for real supervised learning applications"

   - [X] On the chosen solution, show how this improves on previous work

     Best/worst case scenarios

** Write down potential solutions on different sub-problems
   <<sub-problems>>

*** TODO Comparing trajectories
    A distance metric, or some way or
    measuring closeness is needed for classical clustering algorithms. Motion
    patterns can be extracted from clusters.

**** Papers to read
     - cite:Kim2011Nov
     That paper cited by Tiger, finding motion patterns in
     video frames. By constructing a frame for each segment, the same
     ideas should be applicable 

     - [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320318300621][Structured dynamic time warping for continuous hand trajectory gesture recognition]]
     - [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3140017][A Uniform Representation for Trajectory Learning Tasks]]
     - cite:Pimentel2013Sep
       This is the \exact\ same thing as Tiger does, using GP model likelihoods
       as similarity measures, although clustering by
       taking the mean of the trajectories local mean and variance,
       so they don't handle uncertainty properly.
	
     - cite:Tiger2018Jun

**** Suggested solutions
***** Constructing frames and using GPs to interpolate and synchronise
      After synchronised, the trajectories can be compared. This is
      preferably done using a symmetric distance metric which can
      then be used for clustering. [[tiger-questions][what metrics?]]

***** Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
      Doesn't actually synchronise, but computes shortest warp path
      for two trajectories. Has time and space complexity \(\mathcal{O}(NM)\)
      where \(N\), \(M)\ are the lengths of the sequences.

***** Converting to SIT with fixed start and using sum of Euclidian distances
      Based on [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3140017][this paper]]. With a fixed start the trajectories should
      be spatially synchronised. The speed of points could be
      interpolated.

*** TODO Modeling Motion patterns
    A lot of approaches have been explored. Major areas are
    classical clustering with DTW/LCSS, GPs, HMMs, and topic models. 

**** Classical clustering
     - [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1699726][Comparison of Similarity Measures for Trajectory Clustering in Outdoor Surveillance Scenes]]
       <<comp-sim-outdoors>>

     - [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/994784][Discovering similar multidimensional trajectories]]
       They present a new similarity measurement based on LCSS, which
       is designed to be resilient to noise. Is not a proper
       metric. Furthermore, they also highlight a lot of the problems
       with comparing trajectories.
     
**** Hidden Markov Models

     - cite:Suzuki2007Oct
       Old stuff that also use HMM.

     - cite:Morris2008Sep
       Old stuff that used HMM. But interesting approach of fitting a
       Gaussian mixture model to "points of interest" (POI), which could be
       the start and end of a trajectory in the scope of this
       thesis. These POI could be used to construct frames for
       synchronising trajectories.

**** Gaussian Processes

     - [[file:../../shared/modeling-motion-patterns/vehicular-traffic-behavior-from-video.pdf][Understanding vehicular traffic behaviour from video]]
       Discusses several different unsupervised
       techniques. Trajectory based included, but also borrows ideas
       from topic modeling in NLP.

     - cite:Kim2011Nov 
       GP frame paper

     - cite:Wang2013Jan
       Did a survey of clustering metrics in 2013 on vehicular data,
       not outdoors camera imagery. It seems like a
       more useful version of [[comp-sim-outdoors][this]]. They conclude all measurements
       are different and none objectively better.

     - cite:Morris2013Sep
       Talks about a great deal of different models for vehicular
       trajectories. One interesting approach is different types of
       topic modeling to cluster trajectories. Contains a lot of references.

     - cite:Leysen2016Sep
       They claim to have a GP that can fit to several functions. I
       am not sure how their model works with model variance. 

     - cite:Goli2018Jun 
       Modern reference of GPs use in a Connected Vehicles environment

     - cite:Campo2017Aug
       Does some discretisation and then GPs for modeling
       trajectories of surveillance video
 
     - cite:Tiger2015Jul
       Inverse GP
	
     - [[file:../../shared/clustering-trajectories/automatic-model-construction-with-Gaussian-processes.pdf][Automatic model construction with GPs (Phd thesis)]]
       Describes clustering using GPs by warping GMMs. Has no
       closed form for its predictive distribution, but that's should
       be fine since we only want to model different behaviours.  
       "Third, we combine Gaussian processes with the Dirichlet
       process to produce the warped mixture model: a Bayesian clustering
       model having nonparametric cluster shapes, and a corresponding
       latent space in which each cluster has an interpretable parametric form."
       "good representations of data manifolds are invariant in
       directions orthogonal to the data manifold" 

**** Kernel Methods
       - cite:Akbarzadeh2015Sep
	 Seems to do something similar to TDDE19 with comparing
         previously observed trajectories. Tackles the problem of
         predicting future motion patterns, not necessarily arrival
         time so performance metrics does not exactly translate
         (although arrival time could be derived from their approach)

**** Topic Models
      - cite:Zou2016Apr
	Read this! It's on an adapted LDA model for modeling motion patterns

      - cite:Wang2011
	Chapter from a book, seems like it gives a bird eye view. Uses topic modeling on surveillance video to find action sequences

      - Zou2014Aug
	Read this! It's something called (Belief Based) Correlated Topic Models

**** Suggested solutions
***** Spectral Clustering
      Can be used with DTW/LCSS as descibed in
      cite:Zhang2006Aug. Realistically, the evaluation would be done by hand
      picking trajectories and manually asserting correct behaviour.

      DTW does not guarantee that the triangle inequality holds. [[tiger-question-3][question]]

***** Inverse GP Likelihood approach
      The approach used in cite:Kim2011Nov and in the the project
      from this autumn. Based on having a probabilistic model for
      each motion pattern and classifying using maximum likelihood
***** Learn numbers of clusters then the GP "overlapping mixtures of GPs"?
***** Warped GMM from the doctor thesis?
***** Only temporal aspect is important
      Cluster based only on temporal data, which is given once every
      second and could possibly be assumed to be synchronised. Then
      assign new trajectories based on this. (Very domain specific though)


*** TODO Classifying clusters
**** Papers to read
     One of the ones Tiger sent. Go fetch

**** Suggested solutions
     - MAP with uniform cluster prior. Requires a probabilistic
       model. Assign to cluster \(k\) such that \[
     \argmax_{GP_{k]}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=i}^{n} P(GP_{k}(x_i, y_i) | GP_{k})P_{k}
     \] 

*** TODO Extending to multiple stops
**** Papers to read
     Theory behind simple additive model using Laplace approximation cite:Bishop2006Aug
      
**** Suggested solutions
***** An additive model using Laplace approximation in posterior
      mode. Everything would be normally distributed and computable in
      closed form. The posterior arrival time of segment \(k+1\) would
      be \(AT_{k}\) + \(AT_{k+1}\) where \(AT_{k}\) and \(AT_{k+1}\)
      are the Laplace approximations in the mode of the posteriors 
      for the corresponding model \(\mathcal{M}\). For \(\mathcal{M}_{k}\) the posterior is
      computed for the current state, and for \(\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\) it
      is computed either for the first data point in the frame (if
      frames are implemented) or for the mean value for the first data
      point in the \(k+1\) segment. This would require a model for
      \(P(\(\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\) | \(\mathcal{M}_{k}\)), which could be
      as simple as \(\mathcal{M}_{k+1} \sim
      Dir(\alpha_{\mathcal{M}_{k}})\), where
      \(\alpha_{\mathcal{M}_{k}}\) is acquired by counting and
      normalising model transitions. This would be meaningless without
      proper clustering, unfortunately.

*** TODO Extracting events from motions patterns
**** Papers to read
     - cite:duvenaud2013structure
       The idea of searching over kernels to detect structure in data.

**** Suggested solutions
     Convolution/correlation from hand-crafted event-kernels cite:smith1997scientist
     Automated statistician style cite:duvenaud2013structure

*** TODO Model evaluation
**** Arrival time prediction

**** Motion Pattern Clustering
     - If pattern extraction works, check if they contain same patterns?
     - ?

*** TODO Outlier detection
     
** DONE Write thesis plan

* Questions
  A place to quickly jot down questions so they are not forgotten.
** For Tiger
   <<tiger-questions>>
   This section contain questions for Mattias Tiger, supervisor of
   this thesis project.

*** Formulation to motivate novelty of project
    <<tiger-question-1>>

**** Question
     It is sort of doing arrival time prediction, but also motion pattern extraction but
     also analysis of said motion patterns. Most papers found only
     prove a single point, while this project builds upon several techniques.

     What is the problem though? How should this be formulated in the
     thesis? Is it "Finding ways to improve public transport routes", 
     "Learning motion pattern from trajectories", "Motion
     pattern analysis", "..."?.

**** Answer
     Making a competitive GP model is interesting on it's
     own. Further motivating this with the ways the motion patterns
     and predictions can be used. He also said to write more than reasonable 
     think on applications of the models.


*** What distances are available for trajectories?
    <<tiger-question-3>>
    Spectral clustering can be done with similarity measures that are
    not proper distances.

** For Heintz
   This section contain questions for Fredrik Heintz, examiner of
   this thesis project.
