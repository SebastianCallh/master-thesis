* Meetings
** Startup meeting with Heintz
   <2019-01-07 mån>   
*** Initial project- Arrival time prediction with a motion pattern model using GPs
     - A working implementation exists from this years TDDE19 
     - Compare with vector field (position -> velocity), LSTM (from TDDE19)

*** Areas of improvement from TDDE19
    - Sparse GPs
    - Synchronisation. Interpolate posterior mean functions, cluster.
    - Data augmentation
    - Start and stop boundaries
    - Multiple stop prediction
    - Time table feature

*** Notes
    Heintz had some ideas on interesting problems.

**** Superimposing effects 
     The idea is in isolation train a nominal trajectory, one for rush
     hour, on for normal traffics, etc. And in some way superimpose
     the effects, letting us ask questions like "what if we drive
     this way instead?" or  "what if it was winter?".

**** Knowledge extraction
     Predicting arrival time is fine, but not novel
     enough. Fortunately, the GP model offers plenty of insight in the
     data generating process. 

***** Worst/best scenarios     
      If the model was extended to work for
      multiple future stops it could give an estimate of the earliest
      known arrival time, and the latest known. 

***** Pattern extraction
      It would be interesting to extract patterns from the
      data, both spatially and temporally. For instance: stop lights, 
      traffic jams, average speed (?), speed change. During what circumstances
      does the predictions have highest variance?

*** Post meeting talk
    Some ideas that felt reasonable after talking to Tiger after the
    meeting with Heintz.
    - Extract events using kernels/convolution over motion patterns
    - Extending the application to multiple future stops
    - Comparing predictive distribution to the actual arrival times,
      and the predictions of LSTM/vector field model 

** Feedback meeting with Tiger
*** Research questions
**** Is this the most interesting problem?
**** Is the scope of questions reasonable?
      
*** How much to flesh out deterministic methods?
*** Will there be a later subsection where the syncronization ("inverse GP") approach is discussed and referenced?
     - Some synchronisation need to be done, could be with DTW/LCSS
       or inverse GP
     - Find inverse GP synchronisation, and compare it to DTW/LCSSö

*** Write down a case for the final model

*** Related work for event identification
    Automatic statistician, search kernel space, and the kernels
    chosen correspond to events

*** Write down model step by step
    Motivate the models advantages, talk about subproblems. 
    Motivate that the are hard, and what solving them entails.
    Comparing trajectories
    Distance metrics
    Synchronisation 
    Prediction
    Clustering (motion pattern learning)

**** Is the inverse GP model the way to go?
     Sure why not. Make a running example for the application in introduction.

** Thesis plan meeting with Heintz
   <2019-01-18 fre>

   Heintz was pleased with the plan. Some important things are that
   research questions are not easily quantifiable. Problems need to be
   more precisely formulated. He also discussed the possibility to
   generate data for different models. This could be possible with 
   
   A lot of ideas about more specific problems also surfaced.
**** Evaluations
     - Predictions with low residual variance
     - Probability of arriving too late (w.r.t. time tables)
     - Prediction variance as a function of number of observations

** Before half-time seminar
*** What to do for seminar?
    Presentation. Notation. Frågeställningar, resultat, fortsättning, problem

*** Discuss performance plots
    SD and prior for error plots. Prior at /(\tau=0.0/) for baseline.
    Plot state model in SI units, like km/h
    Look over markers of true arrival time
    Plot state model of out of sample that performs good and bad
    Copy-gps to span variance in a new model. Important to check that
    the mean prediction of resulting Laplace approximation is same as
    vanilla model.

*** Discuss DPGP model
    [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-011-9248-x][link]]

**** TODO Comparing trajectories
     A distance metric, or some way or
     measuring closeness is needed for classical clustering algorithms. Motion
     patterns can be extracted from clusters.

***** Papers to read
      - cite:Kim2011Nov
      That paper cited by Tiger, finding motion patterns in
      video frames. By constructing a frame for each segment, the same
      ideas should be applicable 

      - [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320318300621][Structured dynamic time warping for continuous hand trajectory gesture recognition]]
      - [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3140017][A Uniform Representation for Trajectory Learning Tasks]]
      - cite:Pimentel2013Sep
	This is the \exact\ same thing as Tiger does, using GP model likelihoods
	as similarity measures, although clustering by
	taking the mean of the trajectories local mean and variance,
	so they don't handle uncertainty properly.
	
      - cite:Tiger2018Jun

***** Suggested solutions
****** Constructing frames and using GPs to interpolate and synchronise
       After synchronised, the trajectories can be compared. This is
       preferably done using a symmetric distance metric which can
       then be used for clustering. [[tiger-questions][what metrics?]]

****** Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
       Doesn't actually synchronise, but computes shortest warp path
       for two trajectories. Has time and space complexity \(\mathcal{O}(NM)\)
       where \(N\), \(M)\ are the lengths of the sequences.

****** Converting to SIT with fixed start and using sum of Euclidian distances
       Based on [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3140017][this paper]]. With a fixed start the trajectories should
       be spatially synchronised. The speed of points could be
       interpolated.

***** Evaluation
      Based on system performance

**** TODO Modeling Motion patterns
     A lot of approaches have been explored. Major areas are
     classical clustering with DTW/LCSS, GPs, HMMs, and topic models. 

***** Classical clustering
      - [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1699726][Comparison of Similarity Measures for Trajectory Clustering in Outdoor Surveillance Scenes]]
	<<comp-sim-outdoors>>

      - [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/994784][Discovering similar multidimensional trajectories]]
	They present a new similarity measurement based on LCSS, which
	is designed to be resilient to noise. Is not a proper
	metric. Furthermore, they also highlight a lot of the problems
	with comparing trajectories.
     
***** Hidden Markov Models

      - cite:Suzuki2007Oct
	Old stuff that also use HMM.

      - cite:Morris2008Sep
	Old stuff that used HMM. But interesting approach of fitting a
	Gaussian mixture model to "points of interest" (POI), which could be
	the start and end of a trajectory in the scope of this
	thesis. These POI could be used to construct frames for
	synchronising trajectories.

***** Gaussian Processes

      - [[file:../../shared/modeling-motion-patterns/vehicular-traffic-behavior-from-video.pdf][Understanding vehicular traffic behaviour from video]]
	Discusses several different unsupervised
	techniques. Trajectory based included, but also borrows ideas
	from topic modeling in NLP.

      - cite:Kim2011Nov 
	GP frame paper

      - cite:Wang2013Jan
	Did a survey of clustering metrics in 2013 on vehicular data,
	not outdoors camera imagery. It seems like a
	more useful version of [[comp-sim-outdoors][this]]. They conclude all measurements
	are different and none objectively better.

      - cite:Morris2013Sep
	Talks about a great deal of different models for vehicular
	trajectories. One interesting approach is different types of
	topic modeling to cluster trajectories. Contains a lot of references.

      - cite:Leysen2016Sep
	They claim to have a GP that can fit to several functions. I
	am not sure how their model works with model variance. 

      - cite:Goli2018Jun 
	Modern reference of GPs use in a Connected Vehicles environment

      - cite:Campo2017Aug
	Does some discretisation and then GPs for modeling
	trajectories of surveillance video
 
      - cite:Tiger2015Jul
	Inverse GP
	
      - [[file:../../shared/clustering-trajectories/automatic-model-construction-with-Gaussian-processes.pdf][Automatic model construction with GPs (Phd thesis)]]
	Describes clustering using GPs by warping GMMs. Has no
	closed form for its predictive distribution, but that's should
	be fine since we only want to model different behaviours.  
	"Third, we combine Gaussian processes with the Dirichlet
	process to produce the warped mixture model: a Bayesian clustering
	model having nonparametric cluster shapes, and a corresponding
	latent space in which each cluster has an interpretable parametric form."
	"good representations of data manifolds are invariant in
	directions orthogonal to the data manifold" 

***** Kernel Methods
	- cite:Akbarzadeh2015Sep
	  Seems to do something similar to TDDE19 with comparing
          previously observed trajectories. Tackles the problem of
          predicting future motion patterns, not necessarily arrival
          time so performance metrics does not exactly translate
          (although arrival time could be derived from their approach)

***** Topic Models
       - cite:Zou2016Apr
	 Read this! It's on an adapted LDA model for modeling motion patterns

       - cite:Wang2011
	 Chapter from a book, seems like it gives a bird eye view. Uses topic modeling on surveillance video to find action sequences

       - Zou2014Aug
	 Read this! It's something called (Belief Based) Correlated Topic Models

***** Suggested solutions
****** Spectral Clustering
       Can be used with DTW/LCSS as descibed in
       cite:Zhang2006Aug. Realistically, the evaluation would be done by hand
       picking trajectories and manually asserting correct behaviour.

       DTW does not guarantee that the triangle inequality holds. [[tiger-question-3][question]]

****** Inverse GP Likelihood approach
       The approach used in cite:Kim2011Nov and in the the project
       from this autumn. Based on having a probabilistic model for
       each motion pattern and classifying using maximum likelihood
****** Learn numbers of clusters then the GP "overlapping mixtures of GPs"?
****** Warped GMM from the doctor thesis?
****** Only temporal aspect is important
       Cluster based only on temporal data, which is given once every
       second and could possibly be assumed to be synchronised. Then
       assign new trajectories based on this. (Very domain specific though)

***** Evaluation
      Based on system performance
      

**** TODO Classifying clusters
***** Papers to read
      One of the ones Tiger sent. Go fetch

***** Suggested solutions
      - MAP with uniform cluster prior. Requires a probabilistic
	model. Assign to cluster \(k\) such that \[
      \argmax_{GP_{k]}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=i}^{n} P(GP_{k}(x_i, y_i) | GP_{k})P_{k}
      \] 

***** Evaluation
      Based on system performance

**** TODO Extracting events from motion patterns
***** Papers to read
      - cite:duvenaud2013structure
	The idea of searching over kernels to detect structure in data.

***** Papers to read
      Theory behind simple additive model using Laplace approximation cite:Bishop2006Aug
      The one I found this autumn on road networks as Bayesian networks

***** Suggested solutions
****** An additive model using Laplace approximation in posterior
       mode. Everything would be normally distributed and computable in
       closed form. The posterior arrival time of segment \(k+1\) would
       be \(AT_{k}\) + \(AT_{k+1}\) where \(AT_{k}\) and \(AT_{k+1}\)
       are the Laplace approximations in the mode of the posteriors 
       for the corresponding model \(\mathcal{M}\). For \(\mathcal{M}_{k}\) the posterior is
       computed for the current state, and for \(\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\) it
       is computed either for the first data point in the frame (if
       frames are implemented) or for the mean value for the first data
       point in the \(k+1\) segment. This would require a model for
       \(P(\(\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\) | \(\mathcal{M}_{k}\)), which could be
       as simple as \(\mathcal{M}_{k+1} \sim
       Dir(\alpha_{\mathcal{M}_{k}})\), where
       \(\alpha_{\mathcal{M}_{k}}\) is acquired by counting and
       normalising model transitions. This would be meaningless without
       proper clustering, unfortunately.

* Questions
  A place to quickly jot down questions so they are not forgotten.
** For Tiger
   <<tiger-questions>>
   This section contain questions for Mattias Tiger, supervisor of
   this thesis project.

*** Formulation to motivate novelty of project
    <<tiger-question-1>>

**** Question
     It is sort of doing arrival time prediction, but also motion pattern extraction but
     also analysis of said motion patterns. Most papers found only
     prove a single point, while this project builds upon several techniques.

     What is the problem though? How should this be formulated in the
     thesis? Is it "Finding ways to improve public transport routes", 
     "Learning motion pattern from trajectories", "Motion
     pattern analysis", "..."?.

**** Answer
     Making a competitive GP model is interesting on it's
     own. Further motivating this with the ways the motion patterns
     and predictions can be used. He also said to write more than reasonable 
     think on applications of the models.

*** What distances are available for trajectories?
    <<tiger-question-3>>
    Spectral clustering can be done with similarity measures that are
    not proper distances.

*** How to quantify clustering performance?
    Clustered trajectories should have similar arrival time (travel
    time). Do they implicitly by having similar trajectories?
    
*** How to quantify event detection?
    Manually annotate I guess. Unclear. Proof of concept backed by
    domain knowledge might suffice.

*** Can we talk about notation?

*** Why do we map tau -> time?
    Tau represents generalisation to arrival
    
*** Material for Kalman smoother?
    Tiger will email matlab-code for this.  I've borrowed a book on statistical sensor fusion which covers this theory.


*** How do we compute the likelihood?
    We consider S' -> tau as deterministic, so it has to be for tau -> S.
    I assume it is for new observation x, and corresponding tau, but
    for the trajectory model.

*** Why similarity as likelihood and not sum of absolute distances?
    From [[https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.e.bibl.liu.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500676][the paper]], model is selected by maximum likelihood, and no
    posterior is computed. Is this something we want for the
    prediction model? It would motivate a probabilistic measurement

    The probabilisitic model handles uncertainty of the trajectory



*** What math is actually going on when doing model selection before prediction?
    "Jag saknar ett uttryck för 
    P(\mathcal{M}_k \vert X = X_{observed})
    dvs utan beroende på \tau.
    X_{observed} är här en stokastisk variabel som beskriver det observerade statet S (som vi sedan faktiskt observerar) och X är en latent stokastiskt variabel som beskriver vad modellen tror att S ska vara.    Förslagsvis från Bayes sats och 
    P(X = X_{observerd} \vert \mathcal{M}_k, X_{observed})"

    Having m_k | x both in prior and posterior is tripping me up

*** Motivation for interpolating or not when drawing support data
    Varför på de observerade datapunkterna och inte på andra ställen
    utmed mean prediction funktionen? (Det finns för- och nackdelar)

    I lack any motivation for this apart from "it was the most simple
    to implement"


*** What performance metrics are relevant?
    Are there any specific metrics on trajectory data? Not a typical
    problem, where the metric is minimised. Is MSE relevant since
    posterior is gaussian?

    Not sure 

*** Can we define "being synchronised?"
    At first I thought of it as two trajectories having the same
    length, but I guess trajectories are synchronised in tau, where
    this is not the case, so that definition fails.

    They are synchronised as functions of a fixed tau through the
    synchronisation model.

*** How to normalise trajectories?
    As mentioned in week report 8, I am uncertain what the best way to
    do this is.

    Antingen
    1. Antag noll mean. Normalisera var för sig, och spara koordinatsystem
    2. Antag ej noll mean, skatta väntvärde för alla.

    Avbilda alla på x/y. Vi skiter i var vi är i världen, så
    subtrahera medelvärde Det måste vara euklidiskt. Samma skalning
    för alla trajektorier måste användas.Lär normalisering Aldrig
    behandla olika dimensioner för sig!

    Plotta på karta, plotta på normaliserat system

    Fixerad likelihood variance för arrival time. För vi har inga
    kluster, så skapar artificiella.

*** The predictions are very pointy
    Släng på hastighet, det kommer blåsa upp variansen massor och det
    blir bra. Kanske.    


** For Heintz
