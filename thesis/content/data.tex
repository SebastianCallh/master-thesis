\chapter{Data}\label{ch:data}
The data is provided by Östgötatrafiken, and is collected from buses
and trains in service in the public transport system.
A single observation comprises a timestamp, GPS position, and a
specific event type. Depending on the event type,
additional fields are present. There are 22 different event types,
but only four of them are relevant for the thesis project.
The observation format is illustrated in 
Figure~\ref{fig:example-observation}, and event specific fields are
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:example-observation}.

All data is sent from either a bus or a train. However since the thesis
project is limited to buses, observations sent from trains are
discarded. A summary of the different even types, including when they
are sent can be seen in Table~\ref{tbl:event-sent}. A more thorough
exploration of the data can be found in <referera Linus Kortesalmi,
men det finns ej på DIVA>.

While there are many bus lines in the data set, the thesis project
focuses on the first eleven segments of bus line three. The reason for
this is that the data was collected during a period of major
road-building, and to avoid needing to sift through outliers a subset
of the data which was known to be collected during ordinary
circumstances was selected. The chosen trajectories are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:all-trajs}.

    project. The colour indicate progression along the segment, from
    start in bright to end in dark. The observations have been scaled
    to have zero mean and unit variance.}\label{fig:all-trajs}

\resizebox{14.5cm}{!}{
  \begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l| }
    \hline
    Event type & Additional data & Sent \\ 
    \hline
    ObservedPositionEvent &  Velocity, Direction & Approximately every second. \\
    EnteredEvent & Station name & When driving sufficiently close to a bus stop. \\ 
    JourneyStartedEvent & Bus line id & When a bus is assigned a journey, before it
                                        leaves the station. \\
    JourneyCompletedEvent & & When a bus enters the final bus stop on a
                              bus line. \\ 
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
}
\end{table}

Since the ObservedPositionEvent is sent every second it causes
observations to spatially cluster when a bus is standing still. This
happens frequently at bus stops, when a bus stops to pick up or drop
off passengers, but also at the start of the journey. This is because
a bus is assigned a journey several minutes before actually
leaving. A heat map of observations can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:bus203-heatmap} which shows this phenomenon.

    low frequency. The start of the route is in the top left, where
    the frequency of observations is very high. }\label{fig:bus203-heatmap}

% The provided data consists of one file per day, with a total of 92 days between February and April in 2018. Each file has an approximate size of 5 GB, with around 2.4 million observations per file. Within these files are logs over the \textit{events}, which each bus sends throughout the day. The events represent different states of the bus, and there are over 20 different event-types. For this project, only four event-types were needed to successfully extract complete journeys that could be used as input for our models. These four events and their usage are listed below:\\
% \begin{description}
% \item[ObservedPositionEvent:] Is sent by buses with a frequency of 1Hz. This event contains the GPS data, speed, and direction (angle) of a given bus.
% \item[EnteredEvent:] Is triggered when the bus is within a certain distance to a bus station. This event is used to split a journey into segments.
% \item[JourneyStartedEvent:] Is triggered when the bus is assigned a new journey. This event is used to determine which line a bus is currently serving.
% \item[JourneyCompletedEvent:] Is triggered when the bus has completed a journey. This event is used as a flag to determine when a journey has ended.
